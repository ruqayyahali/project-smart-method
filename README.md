# project-smart-method
I made this project to control a robot arm required for a project of the Smart method Company
Where I was able to learn how to start building a robot and how it is operated and controlled
I used html, javascript and ccs
To connect it with a database  necessary use php and mysql
The control interface which is in HTML can be previewed and the desired result can be seen from the work of the codes
The codes were written in notepad
